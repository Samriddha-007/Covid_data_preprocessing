# Covid_data_preprocessing
This project aims to preprocess COVID-19 data for machine learning tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated massive amounts of data from various sources such as government reports, research papers, and online repositories. However, this data often comes in diverse formats and may contain inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. 



Features:
Data Collection: Utilize APIs or web scraping techniques to collect COVID-19 data from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Johns Hopkins University, or government health departments.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in the data. This may involve techniques such as imputation, normalization, and outlier detection.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the raw data. This could include creating new variables, aggregating data over time or regions, and encoding categorical variables.

Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources to enrich the dataset and provide a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 situation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, and trends. Visualization techniques such as plots, graphs, and maps can be used to present findings.

Data Export: Export the preprocessed data to common formats such as CSV or JSON for easy integration with machine learning frameworks.
