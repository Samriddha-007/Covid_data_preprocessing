# Covid_data_preprocessing
This project aims to preprocess COVID-19 data for machine learning tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated massive amounts of data from various sources such as government reports, research papers, and online repositories. However, this data often comes in diverse formats and may contain inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
